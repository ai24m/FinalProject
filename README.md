## Description : 
For an intensive ten days, this final project was developed to culminate the Full Stack, Web-Development application knowledge gathered from Skill Distillery's curriculum over the course of 16 weeks. Each team member fulfilled a role, implementing practical agile development processes. The application began with wire-framing and schema designs. After approval with instructors, we proceeded to build out the JPA (Java Persistence API) to define the entities of the application. Once testing was completed, we proceeded to build out the CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionalities of the entities and their mappings prior to sending them on the front-end server. Finally, the front-end was built out with Angular, where the data passed from our database populates in templates we created.
